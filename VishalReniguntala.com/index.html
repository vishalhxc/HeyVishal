                    <p>
                        I've been working in the field for over 7 years, creating and supporting 
                        applications in organizations of varying size. 
                        I pride myself on my ability to adapt to changes and continually learn along the way.  
                        I enjoy opportunities to be challenged and am always willing to try something new.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People I've worked with would say that I'm enthusiastic, personable, and easy to work with...
                        at least I'd like to think they would.                    
                        At work, I consider myself very team focused. I genuinely enjoy the company of others, and 
                        feel that we can accomplish the most when we are all on the same page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Professionally, I've worked on a .NET stack my whole career, and would consider it my strongest
                        stack to date. However, I always enjoy learning via courses and small projects, usually 
                        trying to incorporate some technology I have never used.

                    <p>
                        Outside of work, I enjoy keeping active by playing basketball. I'm usually the savvy veteran on the
                        court (read: not so quick guy). When I'm not on the court, I enjoy strength training and high intensity
                        interval training cardio. Maybe "enjoy" isn't the right word here. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would also consider myself a great improvisational chef. I can whip up something amazing even when I should
                        have went grocery shopping days ago. I enjoy cooking meals that are well balanced with a South Indian flair.
                        That, or basically anything with bacon. When I'm not chefing, I like to enjoy the variety of food available
                        in the beautiful neighborhood of Uptown.

                        I joined Allstate in 2015, taking a role in the payments and billing operations support area. Our team

                        for all of their payment processing needs. This includes some SOAP services and internal websites 
                        that consumers can use to authorize, tokenize, schedule, and plan payments for Allstate customers. 
                        Due to the importance of the system, there is a need for high-availability with 24/7 coverage spanning
                        3 countries.

                    <p>
                        I started my tenure at APICS as a Junior Developer out of college. We had a relatively small team, with about 3 developers
                        at any given time. About six months into my tenure, I was thrust into the lead developer position, as the other 2 developers
                        left the organization. This trial by fire helped shape me into the person I am today. I took on many projects and technologies I 
                        was previously uncomfortable with, and with the help of great leadership, I was able to deliver results the business was 
                        very pleased with.

                        My work was full-stack, creating the front-end user interface and design, the back-end development work, the design
                        of data structures and tables, and the modules that tied into the employee facing Aptify association management software.

                            into the employee facing Aptify association management software and Sitefinity content management software

                    <p>
                        During my time at DePaul University, I took classes towards my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
                        Most classes focused on development, object-oriented and typically in Java, and to a lesser extent Python,
                        .NET, C/C++, and Scala. I also took some Software Engineering classes, focusing on the design and documentation
                        of new products, rather than implementation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A project of note at DePaul was during my last semester's Senior Capstone. In the class, a development team
                        of 8 students (of varying majors and team roles) designed and implemented a web-based application that
                        monitors and motivates progression towards life goals. Some of the team, myself included, aimed to continue
                        the project after graduation.
