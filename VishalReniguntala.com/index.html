                <h3>About me</h3>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>
                    I've been working in the field for over 7 years, creating and supporting 
                    applications in organizations of varying size. 
                    I pride myself on my ability to adapt to changes and continually learn along the way.  
                    I enjoy opportunities to be challenged and am always willing to try something new.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People I've worked with would say that I'm enthusiastic, personable, and easy to work with...
                    at least I'd like to think they would.                    
                    At work, I consider myself very team focused. I genuinely enjoy the company of others, and 
                    feel that we can accomplish the most when we are all on the same page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professionally, I've worked on a .NET stack my whole career, and would consider it my strongest
                    stack to date. However, I always enjoy learning via courses and small projects, usually 
                    trying to incorporate some technology I have never used.
                </p>
                <h4>Skills</h4>
                <p>
                    Throughout my career (and tinkering), I've picked up some great knowledge when it comes to 
                    languages and tech.

                <h4>Hobbies</h4>
                <p>
                    Outside of work, I enjoy keeping active by playing basketball. I'm usually the savvy veteran on the
                    court (read: not so quick guy). When I'm not on the court, I enjoy strength training and high intensity
                    interval training cardio. Maybe "enjoy" isn't the right word here. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would also consider myself a great improvisational chef. I can whip up something amazing even when I should
                    have went grocery shopping days ago. I enjoy cooking meals that are well balanced with a South Indian flair.
                    That, or basically anything with bacon. When I'm not chefing, I like to enjoy the variety of food available
                    in the beautiful neighborhood of Uptown.

                    I am currently working at Allstate in the payments and billing area. Our team spans three 
                    countries, and supports the production web applications that other areas of Allstate consume
                    for all of their payment processing needs. Due to the importance of the system, there is a need
                    for high-availability with 24/7 coverage.
